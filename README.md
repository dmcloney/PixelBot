# PixelBot
A Discord.js bot for the PixelGalaxxyy Discord server

THIS BOT IS MADE BY A BEGINNER, NOT MEANT TO BE USED BY BEGINNERS

Just a simple guide to setup:

1) Rename "auth.json_sample" to "auth.json"
2) Add your bot token into "auth.json"
3) Change the client.on(ready) data to your Twitch channel (unless you want to support me :D)
4) Change the botchannel const to the ID of the channel you want to bot to read. (Feature is not added to current code)
5) In "radd.js", change the roles (args[] === 'NAME') and role IDs to the roles you want the bot to allow users to add to their accounts.
6) NPM RUN START in the initial folder command prompt
